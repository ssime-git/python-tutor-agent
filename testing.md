Great! Now that the LLMOps architecture is running, let's test it to ensure everything is working properly.

## Testing Your LLMOps Architecture

### 1. Basic Web Interface Test

First, let's verify that the web interface is accessible:

1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. You should see the chat interface with a welcome message from the Python Mentor Agent.

### 2. Testing Core Functionality

Let's test each of the core capabilities:

#### Test the Direct Response Capability
Type a simple query that doesn't require code execution or knowledge retrieval:

```sh
What is Python used for?
```

#### Test the Knowledge Retrieval Capability
Ask a question about Python concepts:
```
How do Python decorators work?
```

#### Test the Code Execution Capability
Ask the agent to write and run some code:
```
Can you write a Python function to find prime numbers up to 50?
```

#### Test Error Handling
Submit code with a deliberate error to see how the system handles it:
```
Can you fix this code: for i in range(10) print(i)
```

### 3. Testing the Isolated Code Execution Container

To verify that code execution is happening in the isolated container:

1. Ask the agent to execute a file system operation:
   ```
   Can you write code to list files in the current directory?
   ```

2. Try to access restricted resources:
   ```
   Can you write code to show system memory usage?
   ```

### 4. Checking LangSmith Tracing

If you've set up LangSmith with your API key:

1. Go to the LangSmith dashboard:
   ```
   https://smith.langchain.com/
   ```

2. Look for your project (named "llmops-demo" in the configuration)

3. You should see traces for your interactions, showing each step of the agent's reasoning process

### 5. Testing LiteLLM Model Use

To verify that your system is using LiteLLM with Gemini Flash:

1. Ask a complex question that requires significant reasoning:
   ```
   What's the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python? Can you explain with examples?
   ```

2. Check the logs to confirm the model being used:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs app | grep "model"
   ```

### 6. Debugging Tips

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Docker container logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```

2. For specific service logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs app
   docker-compose logs code-executor
   docker-compose logs chroma
   ```

3. Connect to the app container to investigate:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app bash
   ```

### 7. Testing Chroma Vector Store

To verify the vector store is working:

1. Ask multiple related questions about the same topic to see if the responses improve as the context builds:
   ```
   What are Python list comprehensions?
   ```
   
   Followed by:
   ```
   Can you show me some advanced examples of list comprehensions?
   ```

### 8. Testing Error Resilience

1. Try to deliberately crash the code executor with an infinite loop:
   ```
   Can you run this code: while True: pass
   ```
   
   The system should terminate the execution after the timeout period.

If all these tests work successfully, your LLMOps architecture is functioning as expected! Let me know if you encounter any specific issues or if you'd like to test additional features.
